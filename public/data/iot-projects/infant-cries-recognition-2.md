# Context and motivation
Multi-modal and multi-location data sources characterize sensor-rich environments and provide various perspectives for a situation to be interpreted.

This project will be held in conjunction with the construction of an IoT-based device which will be responsible of gathering the different signals in real-life settings.
Thus, you will have to manage this situation by assuming the existance of a data stream pertaining to a specific modality and develop proper signal analysis approaches on theoretical datasets, that have to be found.
