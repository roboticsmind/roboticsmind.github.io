# Context and motivation

The ultimate process, which involves this IoT-based device, is illustrated in Figure 1.
We can see that the various signals gathered by the device will be processed by a learning system in order to output a soothing solution based on the reason of the cry.

Note that, you will not be asked to develop the learning system, which is a fairly complex task. The constructed system will, rather, assume that this module exist and will interact with it via an interface that you have to develop.

# Modules to be developed
* RaspberryPi-based station that centeralizes all signals and provide a soothing solution;
* wristlet that monitors biophysiological signals (connected to the station via BLE);
* mobile application for control and visualization via WiFi;
